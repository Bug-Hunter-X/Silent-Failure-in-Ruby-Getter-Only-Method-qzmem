This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Ruby that can be difficult to track down. The `MyClass` attempts to simulate a getter-setter using a single `value` method. However, assignment to `my_object.value` does not modify the internal `@value` instance variable. This can lead to unexpected behavior and silent errors in programs that rely on this value being updated. The solution shows how to correctly implement a setter method to handle updates to the value.
